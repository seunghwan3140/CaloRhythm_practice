## Branch Strategy

This is a simple and small-scale project, and our branch strategy reflects that.

- After each release, new `feature/fix` branches and a `docs` branch are created from main branch based on the version.
- **Feature/fix branches** are used for adding new features, making improvements, and addressing bugs.
- **Docs branches** are used when documentation updates are needed.

Once the work on each branch is completed, it will be reviewed and then merged into the main branch. 
A new version will be released thereafter.
