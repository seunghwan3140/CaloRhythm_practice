## Overview

While modern society provides an abundance of food, it has also led to widespread health problems like obesity. This project provides an intelligent nutrition calculator to help individuals effectively manage their dietary health. Building upon existing calculator functionalities, it aims to maximize user convenience by utilizing data specifically suited for Korea and adding new, innovative features.


## Key Features

- Standard Nutrition Calculation: Calculates and displays the comprehensive nutritional breakdown of a meal based on	      
  user-selected ingredients and their quantities.
- Ingredient Quantity Optimization: Recommends the optimal portion size for each ingredient to best match a user's daily   
  or custom nutritional goals.
- Food Discovery by Nutrient Density: Ranks foods that are highest or lowest in a specific nutrient or filters foods that   
  fall within a user-defined range, normalized per 100-calorie serving.
