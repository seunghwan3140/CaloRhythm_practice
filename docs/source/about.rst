About the Project
=================

**CaloRhythm** is an intelligent, open-source nutrition management system built specifically for the Korean lifestyle.
Powered by **Python** and **Streamlit**, it leverages the **National Standard Food Composition Database (v10.3)** to provide highly accurate nutritional insights and mathematical meal planning.

Our Mission
-----------
While modern society offers access to abundant food, nutritional imbalance has led to increasing rates of obesity and lifestyle-related diseases.
People often lack reliable tools to understand the *exact* nutritional value of their meals in the context of Korean dietary standards.

**CaloRhythm** aims to bridge this gap by combining **official government data** with **advanced optimization algorithms**, enabling users to find their healthy dietary rhythm.

Key Features
------------
CaloRhythm goes beyond simple calorie counting:

* **Localized Precision:** Unlike generic global calculators, we evaluate intake against **KFDA (Ministry of Food and Drug Safety)** daily standards for Korean adults.
* **AI Diet Optimizer:** Utilizing the **SciPy SLSQP algorithm**, the system calculates the mathematically optimal portion sizes to meet your exact calorie and macronutrient goals.
* **Smart Food Discovery:** A data-driven ranking system helps users identify foods high in specific nutrients (Protein, Carbs, Fat) or low in calories instantly.

Project Name
------------
The name **CaloRhythm** combines "Calorie" and "Rhythm."
It reflects our core philosophy: **"Creating a healthy, sustainable rhythm in one’s daily diet."**
The name was selected for its memorability and thematic relevance to long-term health management.

Open Source Philosophy
----------------------
CaloRhythm is proud to be open source.
We believe that health data and tools should be accessible to everyone.
The project is released under the **Apache License 2.0**, allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software freely.
We actively encourage community engagement and contributions to make CaloRhythm better for everyone.
