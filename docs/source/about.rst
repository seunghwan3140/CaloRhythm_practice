About the Project
=================

CaloRhythm is an open-source nutrition analysis system designed to help users
better manage their dietary health. While modern society offers access to
abundant food, it has also contributed to increasing rates of obesity and
lifestyle-related diseases. This project aims to address those issues by
providing a practical, accurate nutrition calculator customized for Korean users.

Project Motivation
------------------
People often lack reliable tools for understanding the nutritional value of
their meals. Existing calculators provide basic information but may not offer
localized data or deeper analytics. CaloRhythm expands these capabilities by
integrating optimization algorithms and nutrient-density search tools.

Key Goals
---------
- Provide a convenient nutrition calculator for diverse health objectives
- Support custom ingredient combinations and quantities
- Deliver insights based on Korean food data sources
- Maintain a fully open-source, community-friendly ecosystem
