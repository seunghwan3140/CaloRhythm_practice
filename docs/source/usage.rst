How to Use
==========

CaloRhythm provides three primary features for interacting with food data and
nutritional goals.

1. Nutrition Calculation
------------------------
Users can select ingredients and input quantities.  
The system computes:

- Total calories  
- Macronutrients (carbs, fat, protein)  
- Additional nutrient breakdown (if available)  

Useful for meal logging and planning.

2. Ingredient Quantity Optimization
-----------------------------------
This feature recommends ideal ingredient ratios based on either:

- User’s daily nutritional goal, or  
- A custom nutrient target for a specific meal  

The backend optimization algorithm adjusts quantities to minimize deviation from
target values.

3. Food Discovery by Nutrient Density
-------------------------------------
CaloRhythm ranks foods normalized per 100 kcal.

Two modes are supported:

- **Ranking Mode:** e.g. Top 5 high-protein foods  
- **Range Filtering:** e.g. foods with 10–15g carbs per 100 kcal  

These functions help users make informed dietary choices.
